## ✨ Key Features
### 🔹 **1. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
- **Encapsulation**: The `Complex` class encapsulates attributes and methods related to complex numbers.
- **Operator Overloading**: Several operators (`<`, `>`, `+=`, `-=`) are overloaded to facilitate intuitive manipulation of `Complex` objects.
- **Constructors and Destructors**: Multiple constructors are provided for different initialization scenarios, along with a destructor to properly free resources.

### 🔹 **2. Program Functionalities**
The program offers a set of interactive commands:
- 📌 **Read a vector of complex numbers**: Enter a list of complex numbers in the format `(real, imaginary)`.
- 📌 **Print the vector of complex numbers**: Display the stored list of complex numbers.
- 📌 **Find and print the largest complex number**: Identify the complex number with the highest value in the vector.
- 📌 **Filter complex numbers in the first quadrant**: Identify and display complex numbers that belong to the first quadrant of the Cartesian plane.
- 📌 **Find the longest subsequence of equal complex numbers**: Detect the longest sequence of repeated numbers in the vector.

### 🔹 **3. Clear and Simple User Interface**
✅ A command menu with numbered options makes navigation intuitive.  
✅ User-friendly messages guide the user through data entry and command execution.

## 🏗️ Code Structure
The program is structured into two main files:
- 📂 **Complex.h / Complex.cpp**: Defines the `Complex` class with its attributes and methods.
- 📂 **Vector.h / Vector.cpp**: Handles vector-related operations involving complex numbers.
- 📂 **Console.h / Console.cpp**: Manages user interaction, command handling, and program logic.
- 📂 **Tests.h / Tests.cpp**: Contains unit tests to verify the correctness of the program.
- 📂 **main.cpp**: The entry point of the application, integrating all components.
